## How to setup Argoverse-api and Lane-GCN?
Install argoverse package and its dependencies from https://github.com/argoai/argoverse-api.

Install dependencies for Lane-GCN from https://github.com/uber-research/LaneGCN.

Check the scripts, and download the processed Lane-GCN data instead of running it for hours.
